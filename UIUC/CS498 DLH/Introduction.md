Deep Learning: models & algorithms
Heath Care: data & applications 

## Health Care
US health care spending in 2019 is 3.6 trillion
935 billion dollar per year is wasted
200k to 400k preventable death per year

Data science can lower cost, better quality
Big data in health care: volume, variety, velocity, veracity

## Potential Applications
Diagnosis: medical imaging analysis, early detection, triaging
Outcome: readmission prediction, length of stay prediction, mortality prediction, sepsis prediction.
Treatment: drug-drug interaction detection, treatment combination recommendation.
Insurance: fraud detection, cost estimation.
Drug: molecule property prediction, molecule generation, clinical trial recruitment.
Public health: epidemiology models.

## Roadmap
Preliminary: Intro, Health Data, ML Basics
Foundation: DNN, embedding
Classical Models: CNN, RNN, auto encoders
Modern Models: attention, graph neural network, memory network, deep generative model.
