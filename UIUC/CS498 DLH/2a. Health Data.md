- pharmaceutical -> researcher -> literature
Data: EHR, medical claims, clinical notes, medical literature, continuous signals, imaging data, medical ontology, clinical trial data, drug discovery data.
## EHR
EHR has demographics, medications, clinical notes and reports, continuous monitoring data, multi-typed medical codes, medical images
- outpatient visit (point): symptom, diagnosis, lab tests, medication prescriptions
- inpatient visit (interval): admission - continuous monitoring data, imaging data -> discharge

Pros: detailed data, objective measures
Cons: noisy, large volume
