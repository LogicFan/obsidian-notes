# Dimensionality Reduction
Reduce dimensionality of the original data while maintaining the underlying data characteristics.
## SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
$$X = U \Sigma V^T$$
where $U^T U = V^T V = I$ and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values. 
## PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Based on SVD, where $U \Sigma$ becomes the principle component. 
# Clustering
Partition the set of data points into homogeneous groups.
## K-means
- Input is a set of data points $(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ and number of clusters $k$.
- Randomly initialize $k$ centers.
- Assign each point to closest center.
- Update center to be the the mean of all points in the clusters.
- Check convergence, if not, run again.
- Output $k$ clusters.
