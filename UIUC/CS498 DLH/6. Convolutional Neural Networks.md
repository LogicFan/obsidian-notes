Convolution Neural Network are specific type of neural network for processing grid-like data. 
# Convolution
It is local connected and weight sharing. Apply the same set of weights for different location. 
# Pooling
The main source of distortion is translation. This can be think of as a down-sampling operation. There are 3 different type of pooling, max, sum and mean.
