# Node Embedding
Map nodes to $d$-dimensional vectors such that similar nodes are close to each other. 
- Embedding function: map a node to a vector
- Similarity function: define relationships of embedding vectors
$$f(v_1) = h_1, s(v_1, v_2) = h_1^T h_2$$
The difficulties includes: arbitrary size and complex structure, no fixed node ordering, dynamic, heterogeneous features. 
# Graph Convolution
Aggregate information from neighbors
$$\sum W h_i$$
