This is an unsupervised learning. It compress data into latent representation than decompress, and try to minimize the reconstruction loss.

This compress similar data to the training data. The compression is lossy.
# Sparse Auto Encoder
We want the encoder to only generate sparse latent variable. Add a regularization term in the loss for sparsity level. 
# Denoising Auto Encoder
Introduce some noise to the input. 
# Stacked Auto Encoder
Stack multiple encoder layers and decoder layers.

This can be trained in a layer-wise fashion.
# Application
- Phenotype Discovery over Noisy Clinical Data.
- Predict the Future of Patient.
