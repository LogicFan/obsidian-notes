Players: patients, providers, researchers, payers, government, pharmaceuticals
Life cycle: 
- patient -> hospital (EHR) -> insurance (medical claims)
- patient -> pharmacy (prescription) -> insurance (pharmacy claims)
- pharmaceutical (clinical trails) -> (hospital, patient, government)
- pharmaceutical -> researcher -> literature
Data: EHR, medical claims, clinical notes, medical literature, continuous signals, imaging data, medical ontology, clinical trial data, drug discovery data.
# EHR
EHR has demographics, medications, clinical notes and reports, continuous monitoring data, multi-typed medical codes, medical images
- outpatient visit (point): symptom, diagnosis, lab tests, medication prescriptions
- inpatient visit (interval): admission - continuous monitoring data, imaging data -> discharge
Pros: rich data types, longitudinal
Cons: complex, siloed data, privacy concern

# Clinical Notes
Clinical notes: free text documents of patient status
SOAP: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan
Pros: detailed, universal, flexible
Cons: unstructured, noisy, sensitive

# Claims Data
Electronic transaction data between patients and healthcare providers.
Medicare vs Commercial insurance
## Medicare
Part A: hospital insurance -> inpatient visit
Part B: medical insurance -> outpatient visit, physician, ambulance
Part C: Medicare advantage plan -> capitation plan
Part D: prescription drugs
## Commercial 
medical & pharmacy
## Claims Data
Member info, date, place
Diagnosis: ICD
Procedure: HCPCS
Drug: NDC
Financial info

Pros: large volume, holistic view, medication compliance
Cons: coding errors, inaccurate data, time lag, temporally limited

# Signals
Continuous signals are commonly collected in hospitals, e.g. SpO2, heart rete, blood pressure, EEG.

Pros: detailed data, objective measures
Cons: noisy, large volume

# Imaging Data
X-ray, CT, MRI, PET-CT, etc.
- full body PET: 9GB
- CT cardiac: 36GB
- fMRI 300GB
total data in US 2014 is 100PB

Pros: object measures, data standard, detailed
Cons: label insufficiency, high dimensional

# Medical Literature
Medical knowledge are documented in medical literature, such as publications and clinical guidelines.

Pros: high quality, comprehensive
Cons: difficult to parse, not machine friendly

# Medical Ontology
Medical ontology are knowledge graphs of different medical terminologies.

Pros: machine readable, easy to integrate
Cons: limited coverage, noise, easily out of date

# Clinical Trial Data
Clinical trial is the process to test the efficacy and safety of a new drug. Data includes: clinical trial protocols, recruitment networks, safety reporting, clinical trail management system. 

Pros: important, heterogeneous
Cons: difficult to match, data integration

# Drug Data
Data about existing drugs & chemical database for drug discovery (e.g. ChEMBL, ZINC, QM9).

Pros: standard, free
Cons: lack of 3D structure, latest novelty chemical data are lacking.
